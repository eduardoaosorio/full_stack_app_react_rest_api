# full_stack_app_react_rest_api

## Description

Client for your [my previously created REST API](https://github.com/eduardoaosorio/rest_api_sql). This full stack application provides a way for users to administer a database containing information about courses. Users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, view details for a specific course, as well as create, update and delete courses in the database.

In addition, the application requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

## Technologies

- React
- React Context API
- React Router
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express
- SQLite
- Sequelize SQL ORM
- CSS
- Basic Auth
- Bcrypt

## How to use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open 2 terminals (1 for the client and 1 for the API)
3. Install dependencies in the client and the API using `$ npm i` on each terminal.
4. Create an initial database with some dummy info by running `$ npm run seed` on the API's terminal.
5. Run `$ npm start` on each terminal. The client will automatically open a window on your browser. If this doesn't happen navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
6. Start using the app. Create a new user or perhaps sign in as an existing user using one of the following credentials:
   - email: `joe@smith.com` password: `joepassword`
   - email: `sally@jones.com` password: `sallypassword`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
